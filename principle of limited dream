Well thiss principle is tricky to understand from the title. Or I would say is badly titled. 

Dreams are extremely important. Dreams are what shape aour live, I am talking about the visualisations we have when we are awake. 
I talk to myself a lot. Especially on days that I interact less with people. 
Talking to oneself slowly drifts into an alternate reality. Focus shifts into the other world from where we live. 

This is dangerous, I fear. Because you are living the unreal. Fuck! 

What life has offered us is right in front of our eyes and other sense organs, but mind however is so powerful that it tunes other senses 
into its own vibration. This is loss of control to some order. Mind is contructiog things and on it's own. When mind has full access 
to tongue, we end up regretting for what was spit out most of the times. 

So dreaming very often is a bad sign. Clearly a bad sign. We have got to combat it. 

Many ways to often take control is to have active sense organs going through what is happening around. 
I especially like it when the space around me is big. Helps me think big. 

My principles are torn apart. My thinking is very negative, and I am offending a lot of people with my behavior. 
I need to demonstrate my ability to gather myself, think big, and do brighter things inlife rather than being stuck with same lot. 

I need to reduce bad habits, and ill-people, and at the same time work on improving what is good for me. 

Dream less and live more, is the motto.
